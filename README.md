Mobile and PC game to simulate “Memory Palace” technique using Unity3D game engine, C# programming language, Android SDK and Google VR SDK. The technique is based on the fact that we’re extremely good at remembering places we know. A ‘Memory Palace’ is a metaphor for any well-known place that you’re able to easily visualize. It can be the inside of your home, or maybe the route you take every day to work. That familiar place will be your guide to store and recall any kind of information.
